Scripts for generating figures for Giustacchini-Thongjuea-et-al.-Nat.Med.2017

These are the codes for generating figures found in Giustacchini and Thongjuea et.al., 
Nat.Med.2017 "Single-cell transcriptomics uncovers distinct molecular signatures of stem cells in chronic myeloid leukemia".

Due to the limitation to store the large file for the Github, please download the R-object data file found in this link 
http://sara.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/public/supatt/Giustacchini-Thongjuea-et-al.-Nat.Med.2017/Data/CML_PROJECT_ALL_CELLs.rdata. 

Then put the file "CML_PROJECT_ALL_CELLs.rdata" in the "Data" directory before running the scripts found in each figure folder.

Please contact supat.thongjuea@imm.ox.ac.uk or supat.thongjuea@gmail.com if you need help.
